                <h3>Mission To The City</h3>
                <p>We are providentially located in the city of Stanton, Orange County, California. And as part of the city, we want to be faithful followers of God; because God cares for the city of Stanton -- and the world for that matter -- we should care for them as well! That is our purpose. Therefore at C4, we are not seeking to just occupy a building, but to engage the city with the Gospel; trying to be an example of what a community is to look like for the city.</p>

                <h3>Manny Ortiz, Westminster Theological Seminary</h3>
                <p>An influential professor of mine, once stated this about grace, "A lone fellow could take a grouping of words and thoughts of very profound experience and put it onto paper and let the world recognize it and enjoy it and that’s genius. Someone else can take a number of metals and place it together into fine machinery and we call that skill. An artist can see scenery, put that onto a canvas and make it lovelier than we can see with our naked eye and we call that art. But God can take you and I, sinners that shook our fist against God, save us by the grace of the Lord, cleanse us by the blood of Christ, fill us with the Holy Spirit, send us into the mission field and make us a blessing to all of humanity and we call that grace."</p>

                <h3>Holistic Worship</h3>
                <p>We believe that as God’s creation we are first and foremost Worshipers. We do this by worshiping the Lord with all our mind, soul and might. We want our church to be theologically sounded, passionate in worship, and socially active in ministry.</p>
                <p>We want to love the Lord our God with all our mind. Christ has redeemed our minds, and so we want to use the mind that God have given us to reflect on him. We believe that part of worship is to rigorously contemplate on our God. Part of that is by learning rich doctrine and having a Christ centered understanding of the Bible, while avoiding cheap and simplistic theology.</p>
                <p>We want to love the Lord our God with all our soul. Part of being human is that we have emotions. We cry, we laugh, and we feel. We believe that God is to be praised with all of our emotions. Therefore we encourage to not hide your feelings, but to bring it to the family of God and share with each other. We are to love the Lord our God from the depth of our soul; with all that we have. Our energy is geared to praising God. We don’t want dead but live praise.</p>
                <p>We want to love the Lord our God with all of our might. We look at what God has done for us, and we can do nothing but be grateful. How do we show that we are grateful? We show that by being ethical, caring for the poor, and actively helping and waiting for the kingdom of God. We believe that though Christian worship is personal and communal; it is never private. We want to become effective for our community and a source of help for our neighborhoods.</p>
                <p>We pray that our worship and ministry is not just in one area, but a balanced, holistic worship: our (C4’s) whole lives offered to God.</p>

                    <p>We believe in the Holy Trinity. The Nicene Mantra is one God, who exists eternally in three persons: the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.</p>

                    <p>We believe that Jesus Christ is the eternal Son of God. He not only became our perfect life and sacrificial death atoning the sins of all who will put their trust in Him, but He also resurrected from the dead; ascended into heaven; and is exalted as the King of Kings and Lord of Lords. Therefore we see him not only as Savior, but as our Lord.</p>

                    <h3>Total Depravity</h3>
                    <p>We believe that Adam was Humanity’s representation and being the first to sin we were all corrupted and blinded by Sin – helplessly sinful. None of our works are pure and pleasing to God. No one could save themselves, except through the mercy and grace of our Sovereign God.</p>

                    <p>We believe the Gospel teaches us to say no to ungodliness. Therefore, now redeemed in Christ, by the Holy Spirit, our whole lives are to be lived to the glory of God. This is our way of showing gratitude..</p>
